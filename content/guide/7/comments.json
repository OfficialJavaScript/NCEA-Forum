It shows that you didn\u2019t just pass \u2014 you did it with merit or excellence.\r\nThere are two main types of endorsements:\r\nCertificate Endorsement (for your overall NCEA level)\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse (or Subject) Endorsement (for individual subjects)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Certificate Endorsement\r\nThis is for your whole NCEA Level 1, 2, or 3 certificate.\r\nTo get your certificate endorsed with Merit or Excellence, you need:\r\nAt least 50 credits at Merit (for Merit Endorsement)\r\n\r\n\r\nOR at least 50 credits at Excellence (for Excellence Endorsement)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The credits can come from any subjects at that NCEA level (or above).\r\nExample:\r\n If you\u2019re in Year 11 and earn 52 credits at Excellence in total across all your subjects, your Level 1 Certificate will be Endorsed with Excellence.\r\n\r\n2. Course (Subject) Endorsement\r\nThis is for doing well in a specific subject in one year (like English or Science).\r\nTo get a Course Endorsement, you need:\r\n14 or more credits in that subject at Merit or Excellence\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least 3 credits from internal assessments\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least 3 credits from external assessments\r\n\r\n\r\n(Some subjects like PE or Art may not have external exams \u2014 that\u2019s okay; NZQA makes exceptions.)\r\nExample:\r\n If you get 16 credits in Level 1 Science with 10 from internal assessments and 6 from external exams, and 14 of those credits are at Excellence, you\u2019ll get a Course Endorsement with Excellence in Science.\r\n\r\nWhy Do Endorsements Matter?\r\nThey show you're performing above the standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey look great on your school reports and future applications (e.g., university, scholarships, jobs).\r\n\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re a good personal goal if you want to challenge yourself.",
