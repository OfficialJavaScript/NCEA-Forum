They only replace some external standards at Level 1 for now.\n\nYoull still have a mix of internals, CAAs, and externals depending on your subjects.\n\nLevels 2 and 3 are mostly unchanged (externals still exist).\n\nTips for Success in CAAs\n\nTreat them seriously - they count just like any other credits\n\nPrepare like you would for an exam (practice past CAAs if your teacher has them)\n\nAsk your teacher when your class is scheduled to sit them\n\nDon't leave revision to the last minute - they can happen anytime in the year\n\nWhy CAAs Matter for You\n\nThey're part of earning your NCEA Level 1\n\nThey spread the load so you're not relying only on November exams\n\nThey help make NCEA more consistent and fair across all schools",
