Use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in NCEA Assessments\r\nAI tools (like ChatGPT or other generative software) are generally not allowed unless your teacher or NZQA specifically permits it for an assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must always produce your own original work. If you use AI or any other help, you need to declare it and make sure it complies with your school\u2019s and NZQA\u2019s rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing AI to generate essays, answers, or assignments without acknowledgment can be considered unauthorized assistance or misconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchools are still developing clear guidelines on AI, so the safest approach is to check with your teacher before using AI tools for assessments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Plagiarism\r\nPlagiarism means using someone else\u2019s work, ideas, words, or images without proper acknowledgment and presenting it as your own.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis includes copying from books, websites, other students, or AI-generated content without referencing the source.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlagiarism is considered serious misconduct and can lead to:\r\n\r\n\r\nLoss of marks\r\n\r\n\r\nDisqualification from the assessment or qualification\r\n\r\n\r\nPossible further disciplinary actions by the school or NZQA\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid plagiarism:\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways reference your sources correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse quotation marks for direct quotes.\r\n\r\n\r\nParaphrase information in your own words and cite the original author.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, ask your teacher how to properly acknowledge sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nAlways do your own work and be honest about any help you receive.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to use AI tools, check with your teacher first and follow their instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAvoid plagiarism by citing all sources and creating original content.\r\n",
