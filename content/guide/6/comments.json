Derived Grade Exams\r\nWhat are Derived Grades?\r\n If you miss an exam, NZQA might give you a grade based on your other work in the same subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcceptable excuses:\r\n\r\n\r\nSerious illness or injury (doctor\u2019s note required)\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily bereavement\r\n\r\n\r\nSerious personal trauma\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural disasters or school closure\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to do:\r\n Tell your school straight away and provide evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Reconsiderations\r\nIf you think your exam was marked incorrectly, you can ask NZQA to check it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsk your school how to apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a deadline after results are released.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Entrance Slip\r\nShows your exam details: subject, paper, time, and room.\r\n\r\n\r\nContains your candidate number.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf lost, ask your school\u2019s exam coordinator for a new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Multiple Papers in One Class\r\nSome subjects have more than one exam paper in a day (e.g., 2 math exams in 3 hours).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan to rest and eat between exams.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Special Conditions\r\nIf you need extra help (like extra time, a reader, or writer), your school can apply for special conditions with NZQA before exams.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese help students with learning or physical needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Exam Rules\r\nDigital Exams: May be done on devices like laptops.\r\n\r\n\r\nClear Bag: Bring only a clear plastic bag with your allowed equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Watches: No watches or smartwatches allowed. Use wall clocks or device time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Rules: No phones, talking, or sharing info during exams.\r\n",
